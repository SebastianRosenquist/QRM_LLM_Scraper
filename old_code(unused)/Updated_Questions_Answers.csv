What is the purpose of the EU AI regulation act?,"The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal 
    framework in particular for the development, the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of 
    artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) in the Union, in accordance with Union values, to promote the uptake of 
    human centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, 
    fundamental  rights  as  enshrined  in  the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European  Union  (the  ‘Charter’), 
    including democracy, the rule of  law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI 
    systems  in  the  Union,  and  to  support  innovation.  This  Regulation  ensures  the  free  movement,  cross-border,  of 
    AI-based  goods  and  services,  thus  preventing  Member  States  from  imposing  restrictions  on  the  development, 
    marketing and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorised by this Regulation.","What are the main challenges and opportunities of AI? How can AI be used in the healthcare sector? These questions 
    and many more will be answered during the first edition of the AI & Healthcare conference in Amsterdam. The conference 
    will be held on the 17th of October 2019 at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The conference is organized 
    by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and the University of Amsterdam. The conference will bring together 
    academics, industry experts and policy makers to discuss the opportunities and challenges of AI in healthcare. The 
    conference will be opened by the Dean of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Prof. dr. ir. Joke Voogd. The 
    conference will be held in the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences building on the Roeterseiland. The building 
    is located in the centre of Amsterdam, at the intersection of the Nieuwe Kadijk and the Prins Hendrikplantsoen. The 
    conference will be held","The EU AI regulation act's purpose is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform

"How does the regulation define 'high-risk AI systems,' and what areas are specifically affected?","High-risk AI systems are those posing significant risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights, especially in biometric identification, education, law enforcement, employment, and essential services.",,,,,,
What measures does the EU AI Act propose to ensure compliance with transparency requirements for AI systems?,"The regulation requires transparency measures like informing users about AI interaction, ensuring documentation and explainability, and marking outputs as AI-generated in cases of synthetic content.",,,,,,
How does the regulation address the use of AI systems for 'real-time' remote biometric identification in public spaces?,"This use is prohibited except in narrowly defined cases of public safety, requiring prior judicial authorization or exceptional emergency measures with strict safeguards.",,,,,,
What are the obligations for deployers of AI systems as outlined in the Act?,"Deployers must monitor system use, ensure input data relevance, maintain system logs, inform affected individuals when using high-risk systems, and comply with human oversight and safety requirements.",,,,,,
What prohibitions are outlined for the use of AI systems to manipulate or exploit vulnerable individuals?,"The regulation prohibits AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities due to age, disability, or economic circumstances to distort behavior and cause significant harm.",,,,,,
How does the regulation ensure that AI systems comply with fundamental rights such as privacy and data protection?,"It aligns with GDPR and includes safeguards for responsible data processing, limiting intrusive uses like mass surveillance.",,,,,,
What exceptions are allowed for the use of AI systems in law enforcement under the EU AI Act?,"Exceptions include searching for missing persons or preventing terrorist threats, with mandatory judicial authorization and proportionality requirements.",,,,,,
What is the role of the European Artificial Intelligence Board as established by the regulation?,"The Board supports implementation, advises on technical and ethical issues, and promotes cooperation among member states.",,,,,,
How does the regulation address the integration of ethical principles into the design of trustworthy AI systems?,"It emphasizes principles such as human oversight, transparency, non-discrimination, and social and environmental well-being.",,,,,,
