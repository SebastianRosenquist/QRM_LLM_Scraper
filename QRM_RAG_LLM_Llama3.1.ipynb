    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Quantative Risk Assesment (QRM) assignement, we will be comparing and quantativly assesing the usability of a Large Language Model (LLM) - in this case Llama3 by Meta - when implemented in a company use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Case\n",
    "The project case focuses on evaluating the risks and benefits of using LLMs to enhance web-scrapers/AI-powered asistants, specifically by comparing their performance with and without Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The goal is to quantify how RAG reduces risks such as hallucination and data inaccuracies, using metrics like Error Rate (ER), and to assess the trade-offs in implementing this approach in a quantitative risk management framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Model\n",
    "Llama 3 by Meta is a transformer-based Large Language Model designed for natural language understanding and generation. It has a data cut-off point from mid-2023, meaning it is trained on datasets available up until that period. Llama 3 is optimized for high efficiency, offering a balance between computational demands and performance, and it supports integration with external tools such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance its ability to work with up-to-date or domain-specific information beyond its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "For our data, we will use the AI-act from the EU, published in 2024. The EU AI Act dataset is particularly suitable for this project because it was published after Llama 3’s data cut-off point (mid-2023). This ensures that the model has not been trained on this document, providing an ideal scenario to evaluate the model's ability to interpret and summarize new, unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the EU AI Act contains complex and structured information, making it a robust test for assessing the model’s performance in understanding and accurately representing legal and technical content. This setup allows for testing how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations when integrated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the LLM to understand the information, the data will be indexed into a vector database to make it searchable by the RAG system."

It sets out a comprehensive approach to regulating AI systems, covering areas such as transparency, accountability, and safety.\n",

The Act emphasizes the need for AI systems to be transparent, explainable, and accountable, ensuring that individuals and organizations can understand how AI systems make decisions and have mechanisms in place to challenge or correct them. Additionally, the Act promotes the development of trustworthy AI systems, encouraging the use of human oversight and ethical considerations in AI design and deployment.\n",

       "  4. Safety and security: AI systems must be safe and secure, with measures in place to prevent and mitigate potential risks and harms.\n",
       "  5. Proportionality: AI systems must be proportionate, with their use and deployment in line with the risks and benefits of the specific application.\n",
       "  6. Data protection and privacy: AI systems must respect data protection and privacy rights, with appropriate measures in place to protect personal data and ensure privacy.\n",

Its primary purpose is to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects fundamental rights, protects individuals, and promotes innovation and competitiveness in the AI sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "Explanation: The EU AI Act is a comprehensive regulatory framework that seeks to address the challenges and opportunities presented by AI technologies. It is designed to provide a clear and consistent set of rules and principles for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems in the EU. The Act aims to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects fundamental rights, protects individuals, and promotes innovation and competitiveness in the AI sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Act covers a wide range of AI systems, including those used in areas such as healthcare, transportation, finance, and public administration. It sets out a series of obligations for AI developers, deployers, and users, including requirements for transparency, accountability, and robustness. The Act also establishes a system of oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the rules and principles set out in the Act.\n",

       "Overall, the EU AI Act is a significant step towards regulating the development and deployment of AI technologies in the EU.

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **Llama3** as the LLM to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solution. For testing purposes, we worked with the **EU AI Act (2023)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings\n",
    "- The RAG model successfully provided accurate answers to questions about the EU AI Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Areas for Improvement\n",
    "To enhance the solution, we plan to:\n",
    "1. **Optimize the Embeddings:** Improve the quality and relevance of the embeddings used in the retrieval process.\n",
    "2. **Implement Advanced RAG Schemes:** Explore and apply more complex RAG architectures for better performance and flexibility.\n"
